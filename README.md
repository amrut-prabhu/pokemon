# pokemon
Pokemon game developed using C++ programming language in grade 12.

This game is similar (but much much smaller scale!) to the Pokemon games that came out on Game Boy.

The program was developed using Visual Studio 2013.

Unfortunately, as this was my first time messing around with the SFML library, I had only optimised it to work on my device 
and some things are not implemented as efficiently/well as I would have liked them to be :/  :-*

However, there are a couple of videos in the repository that you can look at if you want to see the program in action ^Ì®_^
